## Additional Information
### A Few Words about Interfaces for Single Service Classes

I acknowledge that using an interface for every single class is considered bad practice. 
However, using concrete classes instead of interfaces causes Spring to use Cglib instead of 
the native API, which is considered the preferred approach in the Spring documentation. 
Therefore, I have chosen to use interfaces even for a single class.
